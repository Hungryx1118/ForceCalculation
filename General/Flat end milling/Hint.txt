This example contains integrated Process of experiment data extraction and cutting coefficient calculation.

Content:
1. 5 .csv files are the force data exported by .dwd including cutting force of three direction in 1s. 
Export method of .scv
In the DynoWare software, open the .dwd. Click File-Export...-Channel Choose Fx Fy Fz-Value Delimiter Comma (*.scv)-Time Choosing 1s(For example 6s to 7s)

2. The MATLAB code readdata.m can be used to read data from 5 .csv files and save as force.mat.

3. The MATLAB code Cuttingparameters.m is the main code of cutting coefficient calculation.
